Developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network for Pokemon image classification, as part of an assignment of a class. 
The current datset being used can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification

First time using tensorflow and keras for machine learning and I didn't have much time to make a more robust CNN. This means that the validation accuracy is only at 50%. Compared the performance to other algorithms with the same objective and they had better results, however they had much less classes.

Right now I'm thinking of increasing the dataset size by downloading other pokemons images dataset, and with a deeper neural network, I'm hoping to achieve much better accuracy.

I was shy on running this algorithm for long, and right now each epoch takes around 30 seconds to run. Running on my CPU - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H but I might try to make it so that the algorithm runs on the GPU - GeForce RTX 3050Ti.  

Any questions or related feel free to contact me!

### Acknowledgements
Huge thanks to Diogo Cardoso (dfoc) for the help with this assignment. We spent many days trying to use algorithms from out class but ultimately had to transition to tensorflow.


### Disclaimer 
This network is based on the tensorflow Image Classification tutorial and was used only for this assignment purposes. All of the images used belong in the dataset mentioned before.
